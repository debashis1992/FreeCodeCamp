          <p class="card-text">Hitman is an episodic stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A port for Linux, developed and published by Feral Interactive, was released on 16 February 2017.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">The Character</h4>

            <p class="card-text"> A genetically-engineered assassin created from the recombinant DNA of five of the world's most dangerous criminals. The fact that the DNA came from multiple ethnicities allows 47 to blend in to a certain degree in most places in the world, or at least not look immediately suspicious and out-of-place. His name comes from the last two digits of a bar code on the back of his head – 640509-040147. According to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Agent 47 went from being "a mean old hairy guy" to having "hi-tech glasses" before getting to his current design. More inspiration came from "comic books, Hong Kong movies," and other similar media. According to game director Rasmus Højengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the Hitman team.Højengaard felt the idea of creating the "ultimate assassin" by cloning "evolved with the character before the first Hitman game was done". David Bateson has voiced 47 in every Hitman game to date.</p>
